projects:
  - project-title: Towards Night Robust and Improved Depth Completion for Autonomous Driving
    subject: "CS480: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Kaist Exchange Student)"
    time: Spring 2024
    link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/172Ck0xLPSB_vgEGr0b5i438dYFhnaVPX/view?usp=sharing
    details: |
      Proposed a novel Vision Transformer-based dual-branch model for depth completion, effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data.
      Achieved state-of-the-art results on NYUv2 and KITTI night scenes.

  - project-title: Uncertainty-Aware NICE-SLAM for Robust Localization and Mapping
    subject: "SWE3042: Undergraduate Research Program I"
    time: Summer 2024
    link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gu2IWSwtq-dTzPoMpIET8EjGZ6-ltxcy/view?usp=drive_link
    details: |
      Enhanced NICE-SLAM by incorporating uncertainty estimation into both photometric and geometric losses, resulting in improved robustness under challenging sensor conditions
      
  - project-title: PCC-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression for XYZ
    subject: "ICE2009: Undergraduate Research Program II"
    time: Fall 2024
    link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJWsW4r2R3DIehvMFFh2T7qL2BrF1h4r/view?usp=sharing
    details: |
      Proposed a framework that exclusively compresses xyz coordinates of 3DGS using a PCC model, enabling seamless integration with existing attribute compression methods. 
      Fine-tuning the PCC decoder boosts PSNR and storage efficiency, as demonstrated on Synthetic NeRF datasets.
  
  - project-title: Adaptive Image Downscaling via INR-Based End-to-End Optimization for Task-Aware Compression
    subject: "ICE2012: Undergraduate Research Program III"
    time: Winter 2024
    link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11V2xjgNGemmInXFrasqOCVRdLVqmzgO_/view?usp=sharing
    details: |
      Proposed an end-to-end pipeline using INR-based differentiable downscaling and a learned scale predictor to optimize rate-accuracy trade-off for object detection. 
      Achieved higher mAP at lower bitrates compared to traditional JPEG compression on the COCO dataset.

  - project-title: "Planets in Shadows"
    subject: "SWE3008: Introduction to Computer Graphics"
    time: Spring 2025
    link:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PgYGObd-V8EPPGE2ulgS2-ckLJnTZ1la/view?usp=drive_link
    details: |
      Built an OpenGL renderer displaying nine textured planets in a Cornell Box with real-time shadows. Used per-fragment Blinn-Phong shading and ray-casting in GLSL to compute physically correct shadows, including self-shadow avoidance and interactive camera controls.

  - project-title: "Image2History3D: Progressive 3D Rendering of Drawing History from a Single Image"
    subject: "CS479: Machine Learning for 3D Data (KAIST Exchange Student)"
    time: Spring 2025
    link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhdbLAfRSM1yjeMi8Y7Gr-ze9Zi_NX8v/view?usp=sharing
    details: |
      Proposed a novel rendering method that visualizes the entire drawing history of a 3D object by dynamically controlling Gaussian primitive opacity using binary masks, built on top of existing models (Paints-Undo and Triplane-Gaussian) for drawing stage extraction and 3D reconstruction.
