projects:
  - project-title: Towards Night Robust and Improved Depth Completion for Autonmous Driving
    subject: "CS480: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Kaist Exchange Student)"
    time: Spring 2023
    link: #
    details: |
      Proposed a novel Vision Transformer-based dual-branch model for depth completion, effectively fusing LiDAR and camera data.
      Achieved state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and Night-scene KITTI, including night conditions.

  - project-title: Uncertainty-Aware NICE-SLAM for Robust Localization and Mapping
    subject: Undergraduate Research Program I
    time: Summer 2023
    link: #
    details: |
      Enhanced NICE-SLAM by integrating uncertainty estimation into photometric and geometric loss, 
      improving robustness in uncertain conditions. 
      Achieved superior performance on the Replica dataset, demonstrating better adaptability to real-world sensor noise.
      
  - project-title: PCC-Based 3D Gaussian Splatting Compression for XYZ
    subject: Undergraduate Research Program II
    time: Fall 2023
    link: #
    details: |
      Proposed a framework that exclusively compresses xyz coordinates using a PCC model, enabling seamless integration with existing attribute compression methods. 
      Fine-tuning the PCC decoder boosts PSNR and storage efficiency, as demonstrated on Synthetic NeRF and Tanks&Temples datasets.
  
  - project-title: Adaptive Image Downscaling via INR-Based End-to-End Optimization for Task-Aware Compression
    subject: Undergraduate Research Program III
    time: Winter 2023
    link: #
    details: |
      Proposed an end-to-end pipeline using INR-based differentiable downscaling and a learned scale predictor to optimize rate-accuracy trade-off for object detection. 
      Achieved higher mAP at lower bitrates compared to traditional JPEG compression on the COCO dataset.
